Within the Balıklıgöl complex, there are the Halil-ur Rahman and the Ayn Zeliha lakes, canals connecting these two lakes, historical mosques and madrasas. Balıklıgöl is Şanlıurfa’s coolest, greenest and biggest wetland in the region. It also has a mystical and spiritual atmosphere. The fish in the Halil-ur Rahman Lake are considered sacred, respected by the people and cannot be eaten. According to narrations, Prophet Ibrahim’s mother had to hide in a cave near the lake to give birth to him, because the cruel ruler Nimrod slaughtered baby boys by sword. Afterwards, Prophet Ibrahim was fed and raised sometimes by his mother and sometimes by gazelles. When Prophet Ibrahim started to teach the monotheistic belief, he entered into a tough struggle with the Nimrod and the pagans. And when he destroyed the idols in the temple, Nimrod wanted to burn him on a large pile of wood as an exemplary punishment. The moment Prophet Ibrahim was set on fire, the fire turned into a clear pool. The burning wood turned into fish. This is why we call this lake Balıklıgöl today, and why the fish are considered sacred. Upon this, Zeliha, the daughter of Nimrod also believed in the God of Prophet Ibrahim.  Thus, Nimrod also threw his daughter to the fire. For this reason, the small pond right next to Balıklıgöl is popularly known as Ayn-ı Zeliha."

The local people believe that these two columns are the legs of the catapult mentioned in the legend of Abraham. The height of the columns is 17.25 meters and there is an inscription in Syriac on the east column. It reads “I am AFTUHA, son of military commander BARSHAMASH (son of the Sun). I have erected this column and the statue on it for crown prince MA’NU’s daughter, king MA’NU’s daughter, my lady and precious queen Shalmeth.” These columns represent the twin gods.

What makes Tavas Baklava special is the ingredients and cooking technique used in it. The Baklava phyllo is rolled up using “urga flour”, which is a mixture of wheat, whole wheat and barley flour. It is cooked for 25-30 minutes in a wood oven called a black oven in a copper tray over an oak wood fire. In order to get the real taste of Tavas Baklava, it must be rested for a day. It is recommended to eat the baklava, which is ready for service, by hand. The famous taste of Tavas, Pide with Tahini with Honey, is consumed as a dessert, unlike traditional pita. Dough meringues made of yeast dough are rolled by hand and covered with tahini mixture. After resting for a while, pide with tahini, cooked on a wood fire, is sweetened by pouring honey on it and served hot. This pita, which must be tasted, is called “İçli-Dışlı” by Tavas people."
